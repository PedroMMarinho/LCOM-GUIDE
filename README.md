# Welcome to LCOM ‚Äì Low-Level Programming and Computer Organization

Welcome to the [LCOM](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=520323) (Low-Level Programming and Computer Organization) guide! üöÄ This document will help you navigate through the course and its labs, covering key concepts and hands-on exercises to develop your skills in **low-level programming**, **hardware interaction**, and **systems programming**.

## üìå Course Overview
LCOM focuses on:
- Understanding **computer architecture** and **low-level programming**.
- Writing **bare-metal C code** for hardware interaction.
- Working with **interrupts, timers, I/O devices, and graphics programming**.

- Writing simple **kernel-level** programs.
- Understanding **system calls** and debugging techniques.

### **Lab 2: Timer and Interrupts**
- Working with **timers and delays**.
- Using the **RTC (Real-Time Clock)**.
- Managing multiple **interrupts** efficiently.

### **Lab 3: Keyboard and Input Handling**

- Interacting with the **keyboard controller**.
- Handling **scancodes**, make/break codes.
- Using **interrupt-driven** programming.

### **Lab 4: Mouse Programming**
- Handling **mouse events**.
- Interpreting **mouse packets**.
- Combining **keyboard and mouse input**.

### **Lab 5: Graphics Programming**

- Setting video modes and drawing pixels.
- Working with **double buffering**.
- Creating simple animations.


### **Lab 6: Serial Port Communication**
- Communicating via **serial ports**.
- Understanding **UART protocols**.

### **Final Project: Bringing Everything Together**
- Developing a small interactive **game** or **application**.
- Combining **interrupts, graphics, and input handling**.
